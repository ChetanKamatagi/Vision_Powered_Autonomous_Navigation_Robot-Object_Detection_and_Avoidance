# Project Title: Autonomous Robot with Object Detection and Avoidance

## Description:
Welcome to the world of autonomous robotics! This project showcases a remarkable autonomous robot equipped with the ability to autonomously detect obstacles, avoid collisions, and navigate seamlessly from its starting point to a designated final destination. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, the robot employs the YOLOv5 model for precise object detection using an external camera.

## Key Features:

* Autonomous Navigation: Watch as the robot independently navigates through complex environments, demonstrating its real-time decision-making capabilities.
* Object Detection: The integration of the YOLOv5 model enables the robot to accurately identify obstacles in its path.
* Obstacle Avoidance: The robot employs sophisticated algorithms to determine optimal paths, ensuring smooth and collision-free movement.
* Navigation System: Explore the intelligent navigation system that guides the robot from its initial position to the desired endpoint.
* Future-Ready: This project opens doors to a multitude of applications, from warehouse automation to assistive robotics.
